### 2026-11-01 — ChatGPT → Claude Code — VIS-001 — Initial visual audit handoff
- **Status:** proposal
- **Context:** `DESIGN.md` art style rules; `CLAUDE.md` SpriteCook and capture workflow
- **Message:** Before regenerating large amounts of artwork, audit existing farm assets, rendering scale/camera conventions and Godot lighting. Identify inconsistent pixel scale, perspective, texture density and baked-in lighting. Maintain straight-on three-quarter top-down square-grid presentation; do not drift toward isometric. Distinguish what Godot should render dynamically from what belongs in source sprites.
- **Action requested:** With owner approval, produce an inventory, a prioritized improvement proposal and matching daytime/dusk/night screenshots. Do not alter production assets or gameplay during the audit.
- **Approval:** pending
